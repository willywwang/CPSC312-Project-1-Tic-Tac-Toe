Tic-tac-toe implemented in prolog with artificial intelligence

### How to play Player vs. Player:
Letâ€™s say player 1 wants to place his/her marker x, in position [1,2]. Hence, the query used would be
<br/> 
?-game(x,[1,2],[e,e,e,e,e,e,e,e,e],R,R1].
<br/>
Player 2 then takes the output value R to make his move.
<br/>
?-game(y,[1,3],[e,x,e,e,e,e,e,e,e],R,R1].

### How to play Player vs. Ai:
Let the first parameter be your intended move or leave it empty to let the AI go first.
<br/>
?-gameWithAi([],[e,e,e,e,e,e,e,e,e],R,R1,R2).
